# Battleship_game_simple

### This Version:
It is simple version. We don't placeany ships of our own. Instead our job is to sink the computer's ships in the fewest number of guesses.
## Goal:
Sink all of the computer's Dot Coms in the fewest number of guesses. You're given a rating or level, based on how well you perform.

## Setup:
When the game program is launched, the computer places three Dot Coms on a virtual 7 x 7 grid. When that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.

## How you play:
This version works only at the command-line. The computer will prompt you to enter a guess (a cell), that you will type at the command-line as "A3", "C5". etc. In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line, either "Hit". "Miss", or "You sunk Pets. com" (or whatever the lucky Dot Com of the day is). When you have sent all threee Dot Coms to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your rating.
